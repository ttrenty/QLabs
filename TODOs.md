# TODOs

A pure state is represented by a ket vector, e.g., $ |\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle $, where $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ are complex numbers satisfying the normalization condition $ |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1 $.

## Ordered by Priority (5 ↑) / Difficulty (5 ↓)

- 5 / 1 : density matrix calculcation from state vectors

- 5 / 5 : Extend qubitWiseMultiply() to 2 and multiple qubits gates (Test it)

- 4 / 3 : Implement measurement gates

 - 4 / 5 : Implement the computation of statistics: (6.5 and 6.6)

- 3 / 2 :  Use a separate list for things that are not real gate to not slow down the main run logic

- 3 / 2 :  Use a separate list for things that are not real gate to not slow down the main run logic

- 3 / 3 : Implement naive implementation of the functions 
    - matrix multiplication (but starting from right or smart)
    - partial trace

- 3 / 4 : Compile time circuit creation?

- 3 / 2 : Reproduce table from page 10
